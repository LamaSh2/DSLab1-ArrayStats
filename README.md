# Data Structures Lab 1 - ArrayStats

This project is part of the Data Structures course lab 1. It is a Java program that focuses on array manipulation and basic calculations. The program allows users to input two arrays, perform operations such as finding the maximum, minimum, and average values of the arrays, and displays the results. It includes input validation to ensure that the array sizes and values are valid integers. The program provides a menu-driven interface for easy navigation and interaction.

## Features

- Input two arrays and perform mathematical operations on them.
- Find the maximum, minimum, and average values of the arrays.
- Validate input to ensure array sizes and values are valid integers.
- User-friendly menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling to handle invalid input and prevent crashes. Here are the types of error handling implemented:

- Invalid Array Size: The program ensures that the array sizes are positive integers. If a non-positive value is entered, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to enter a valid size.

- Invalid Array Values: When entering the array values, the program validates that only integer values are provided. If a non-integer value is entered, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to enter a valid integer.

- Invalid Menu Choice: The program validates the user's menu choice to ensure it is a valid option. If an invalid choice is entered, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to enter a valid choice.
